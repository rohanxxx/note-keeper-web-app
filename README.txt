App running instructions:

frontend:
- go to frontend directory then do yarn start in commandline 
- then on a web browser open this link: http://localhost:3000
- that's how you locally run it
- lastly before you do all of these don't forget to do yarn start 
- in your backend directory. Then the backend of the app will start running
- thank you :)
